Microsoft PdM Case Study in R and Python
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) using R and Python based on the Microsoft case study. The analysis leverages multiple datasets to predict failures and improve maintenance strategies.

Datasets
The following CSV files are used in this study:

maintenance.csv – Maintenance records of machines.
telemetry.csv – Sensor data collected over time.
errors.csv – Log of error events before machine failures.
failure.csv – Historical records of machine failures.
machine.csv – Metadata about the machines (e.g., model, age).
Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and merging the datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for predictive modeling.
Model Training: Applying machine learning techniques in R and Python.
Evaluation & Insights: Assessing model performance and drawing conclusions.
Technologies Used
R (tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, randomForest, etc.)
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, etc.)
Data Visualization (ggplot2, plotly)
Machine Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
